This directory includes a sample Jupyter Notebook with simple Arabic data set and pipe for single label classification. 
The sole purpose of this example is to assure that development environment is working properly. 

Please follow the instructions below:
1. Clone current repository into your home directory.
2. In Terminal, go to  ~/example/notebooks, type 'jupyter notebook'.
3.  From Home page, load classificationWithW2V.ipynb (by click on its name)
4. Clean output of all cells (Cell -> All output -> Clear)
5. Launch notebook (Cell -> Run All). Alternatively you can run each cell individually (from top to bottom, strictly following the sequence).
6. If you want rerun the notebook, restart the Kernel and clean all outputs (Kernel -> Restart & Clear Output).
