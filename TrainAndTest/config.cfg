# === Requests ===
# Request defines the pipe - chain of processes, in which previous processes can prepare data or set parameters
# for subsequent. Processes are separated by symbol '|'. Currently we support 5 types of processes:
# W - word embedding
# T - tokenization
# D - data loading
# M - create/train/test model
# C - collector (consolidate results of model's testing and save resources for runtime)
# Each process has the following structure:
# <Symbol_of_process>(<list_of_parameters)
# List of parameters is a list of configuration's options, which should be changed for current and subsequent
# processes.
